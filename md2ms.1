.TH MD2MS 1
.SH NAME
md2ms \- Markdown to troff -ms macros
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B md2ms
[
.BI eqndelim= xy
]
[
.IR file ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Md2ms
reads the named Markdown input
.IR files
and converts them into
.IR troff (1)
input.
The
.I troff
input generated by
.I md2ms
uses macros defined in the
.IR ms (7)
macro package.
.PP
.I Md2ms
recognizes Markdown as defined in the original
.I Daring Fireball
syntax guide, augmented with a few extensions from Pandoc's Markdown.
They are:
.IP "Inline math"
If
.BI eqndelim= xy
is given on the command line, the pair of characters
.I xy
is understood to delimit inline
.IR eqn (1)
input.
The text within and including these delimiters is passed verbatim to the output.
If
.I y
is missing, it is taken to be
.IR x ;
if
.I x
is missing, inline math is disabled.
.I Md2ms
always outputs an
.I eqn
block setting the inline delimiter to
.I xy
(or
.BR off )
when
.I md2ms
starts processing an input file,
so the user needn't specify it separately for
.I eqn
when
.I md2ms
is used in a
.I troff
pipeline.
.IP "Citations"
Words matching the regular expression
.I @[A-Za-z0-9'-]+
are output as
.IR refer (1)
citations.
One can optionally bracket such a word with
.BR [] .
Several citations can also be grouped within a single pair of brackets by
separating them from each other with semicolons.
.IP "Inline footnotes"
Input
.I text
of the form
.BI ^[ text ]
is output as
.I ms
footnotes.
.I Md2ms
additionally defines the number register
.IR FN ,
which is used to keep a running count of the footnotes.
The in-text label of a footnote is
.I FN
wrapped by the string registers
.I [.
and
.IR .] ,
which are also used by
.IR refer .
.IP "Smart punctuation"
Double hyphens and triple hyphens are output as the
.I troff
escape sequences for en dashes and em dashes respectively.
Typewriter single and double quotes are output as the troff sequences for their
curved counterparts.
Multiple spaces are converted into line breaks:
if two spaces (or a newline) follow each sentence of input,
.I troff
can typeset end-of-sentence spacing better.
Multiple spaces at the end of a line still cause, as per Markdown,
a hard line break
.RB ( .br .)
.IP "Intra-word emphasis"
Underscores in the middle of a word won't trigger emphasis,
but asterisks still will.
.PP
.I Md2ms
passes
.I troff
requests and escapes through verbatim, just as Markdown does with HTML.
This is the preferred means of customizing
.I md2ms
output: redefine the
.I troff
macros and string and number registers it uses at the start of a file.
Nonempty lines immediately following
.I troff
requests are also not processed, so
.I troff
preprocessor commands can be embedded in your Markdown source.
.PP
.I Troff
and Markdown are very different languages,
so a 1:1 mapping between them is impossible.
See the extensive
.B BUGS
section for what is lost and altered in translation.

.SH BUGS
.I Ms 
only defines nesting for the
.B .IP
macro.
.I Md2ms
uses it to implement lists,
so they are the only block elements that can be safely nested.
To implement strong emphasis,
.I md2ms
uses the macro
.B .BI
to format spans wrapped in triple asterisks or underscores.
.PP
.I Ms
has no concept of hyperlinks, so they are implemented as footnotes.
Autolinked URIs and e-mail addresses are simply output in a constant-width
font.
.PP
.I Ms
does not define a horizontal rule macro, so
.I md2ms
does it instead:
.IP
.EX
\&.de HR
\&.br
\&.tl ''* * *''
\&..
.EE
.PP
.I Troff
only supports embedding PostScript images.
.I Md2ms
uses the
.B .BP
macro in
.IR mpictures (7)
to do this.
It contains no provisions for handling alt text, which is ignored.
.PP
Markdown makes no distinction between numbered and unnumbered headings,
or indented and left-blocked paragraphs.
.I Md2ms
opts to output every heading with the
.B .NH
macro and every paragraph with the
.B .PP
macro.
.PP
A backslash followed by an asterisk in the input is ambiguous,
as it both escapes emphasis in Markdown and
begins the interpolation of a string register in
.IR troff .
In
.IR md2ms ,
it only performs the former function.
.PP
Ordered lists do not have their ordinals computed on the go:
they are output as they are in the source.
Likewise, unordered lists use as bullet points
the characters they were invoked with in the source.
.PP
.I Md2ms
is implemented as a single-pass formatter without lookahead,
so reference-style images and links and
setext-style headers cannot be supported.
There is also no graceful backtracking from unclosed span elements.
.PP
.I Md2ms
is an
.IR awk (1)
script,
so the command line parsing rules described on its manual page also apply here.
As such, take care not to give
.I md2ms
arguments that resemble options or variable assignments not defined above.
.PP
.I Md2ms
is unlikely to parse edge cases identically to any other Markdown
implementation.
